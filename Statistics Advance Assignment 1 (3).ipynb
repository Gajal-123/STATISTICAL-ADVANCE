    "18. What is the significance of confidence intervals in statistical analysis?\n",
    "    -\n",
    "    Confidence intervals (CIs) play a crucial role in statistical analysis by providing more information than a single point estimate. Here’s why they are significant:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1.Measure of Precision\n",
    " - A confidence interval shows the precision of a sample estimate.\n",
    " - A narrow interval means high precision, while a wide interval suggests more variability or uncertainty in the estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    " 2.Quantifies Uncertainty\n",
    " - A point estimate alone (like the sample mean) doesn’t indicate how reliable it is.\n",
    " - A confidence interval captures the uncertainty associated with sampling by giving a range likely to contain the true population parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    " 3.Supports Decision Making\n",
    " - In research, CIs help determine if an effect is statistically significant.\n",
    " - Example: If a 95% CI for the difference in means is (2.1, 5.6) and does not include 0, this suggests a statistically significant difference.\n",
    "\n",
    " 4.Alternative to Hypothesis Testing\n",
    " - CIs give a more intuitive understanding than just p-values.\n",
    " - They show not just whether an effect exists, but how large it might be.\n",
    "\n",
    " 5.Helps in Generalization\n",
    " - Confidence intervals give insight into how much the sample result may differ from the population value, aiding generalization from sample to population.\n",
    "\n",
    " 6.Indicates Reliability of Estimates\n",
    " - For example, if a poll estimates a candidate has 55% support with a 95% CI of (52%, 58%), it means we’re 95% confident the actual support lies in that range.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say the mean systolic blood pressure from a sample is 130 mmHg, and the 95% CI is (127, 133).\n",
    "\n",
    " - This interval communicates more than just saying “mean = 130.”\n",

    "\n",
    " 1.Independent Observations\n",

    "     -\n",
    "     A probability distribution describes how probabilities are assigned to all possible values of a random variable, while the expected outcome (expected value) is a summary statistic derived from that distribution. Together, they provide a complete picture of what outcomes are possible and what the average outcome would be over the long run.\n",

    "-> Key Relationship:\n",
    " - A random variable can take on different values, each with an associated probability given by the probability distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    " - The expected outcome (or expected value) is the weighted average of all possible values, using the probabilities from the distribution as weights.\n",
